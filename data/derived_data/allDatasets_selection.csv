Also, the socio-economic importance of the BCS is very high. As in most areas around the North Sea, a lot of anthropogenic activities, such as sea fisheries, maritime transport, military shootings, dredging activities and others occur on the BCS.<p>The combination of the ecological and the socio-economic value of the BCS causes conflicts between both interests. Therefore it is very important to develop a sustainable management plan for the natural resources of the BCS. To obtain this goal, information and knowledge is required about:<ul><li>geographical distribution of the marine biological communities,<li>the structure of these communities,<li>their relationship with the physical and the chemical environment,<li>the natural ecological and genetic variability, and<li>the nature and the effect of the anthropogenic influences on these ecosystem components. </ul><p>Macrobenthic organisms are good candidates for monitoring the short and long-term effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts on and within the marine environment because of their direct link with the sediment and with the processes that occur immediately above the sediments.<p>The <b>global objective</b> of this project is to deliver a substantial contribution to the knowledge of the long term variability in the biodiversity of the macrobenthos and the relationship with anthropogenic activities.<p>The <b>specific aim</b> of this website is to deliver an atlas with distribution maps of the macrobenthos of the Belgian Coastal Shelf (BCS) for the periods 1977-1983 and 1994-2000. Besides biogeographic and taxonomy information, which is given for each taxon, descriptive details on morphology, biology, ecology, habitat preferences and illustrations are given for a limited number a taxa (see list below).

However, this dataset comprises those data that were paid for by CCW directly. The data contributed to the MNCR programme which was initiated to provide a comprehensive baseline of information on marine habitats and their associated species around the coast of Britain which would aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance. The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as 'biotopes') in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.

Methods of data capture
The majority of data were collected using methods described in the MNCR Rational and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Broadly, this encompassed surveying a range of sites within a geographical area to sample and describe the variety of habitats present (sampling habitats in different substrata, depths, wave exposures, current regimes, salinity regimes and so on). Each habitat was sampled using semi-quantitative recording techniques (SACFOR abundance scales) for recording epibiota on rocky habitats.

Geographical Coverage
This dataset relates to Wales. Note however that the dataset ""Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) and associated benthic marine data held and managed by JNCC"" also includes equivalent and complementary data from Wales.

Temporal Coverage 
The data were collected post 1993. 

Data Quality
The data have been extensively checked during the course of the creation of the various reports produced by the MNCR programme. This included the MNCR Area Summary report series which describes the marine habitats in particular regions around the UK and the creation of the national marine habitat (biotope) classification system. Through this work the vast majority of the anomalies and errors in the data should have been identified but some may still remain.",,T,T,"Biology , Benthos , Macroalgae , Fish","Biodiversiteit , Marine biodiversity"

Additionally species records determined from SNH analysis of third party commissioned benthic survey video footage are included. The dataset contains surveys which contributed to the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) programme, EU-funded BioMar Life project, SNH Site Condition Monitoring including broad scale surveys in support of the Natura process, surveys to establish the impact of specific activities on marine habitats and species and surveys to support the Scottish Marine Protected Areas project.","Purpose of data capture: Records in this dataset were originally collected for a variety of purposes including: identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance, to support protected site designation or to support site condition monitoring. This dataset is a collation of species records from these surveys and has been produced to mobilise these records to a broad spectrum of users and in so doing it contributes to Scottish Natural Heritage?s ongoing commitment to the National Biodiversity Network.

Methods of data capture: Records in the dataset were collected as a result of commissioned surveys which used a range of methodologies often closely aligned with those of the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) as described in the MNCR Rational and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Surveys were typically undertaken using one or more of the following techniques, remotely operated video (ROV), drop-down or towed video, grab sampling, core sampling, clump sampling, diver video, MNCR phase 2 diver recording, and intertidal transects and quadrats. Most commonly semi-quantitative recording techniques have been applied using the SACFOR abundance scale, but species presence, and count data have also been used. Typically although not presented in this dataset the surveys would also have described the variety of habitats present (detailing substrata, depths, wave exposures, current regimes, salinity and so on). Verification and validation of records has typically focused on a quality assurance protocol for taxon determination and data entry.

Geographical coverage: The records in this dataset relate to the Scottish Marine Area, but have a predominant near-shore focus in their distribution.

Temporal coverage: The records present in this dataset relate to field surveys 1993 up to and including 2012.

Data quality: The majority of records have been subjected to quality assurance procedures which includes an independent oversight of a sub-set of records from each survey and specialist taxonomic input. In addition some of the data has been subject to NMBAQC protocols. Additionally, SNH project managers? have an oversight on the survey deliverables. Overall confidence in the dataset is high although it is conceivable that errors exist in this dataset. SNH view mobilisation of these records to the NBN Gateway as a further mechanism for assuring data quality. If users of the Gateway identify potential errors in the dataset then these should be flagged with SNH who will consider all feedback.",,T,T,"Biology , Benthos , Invertebrates , Macroalgae , Plants , Fish",Biodiversiteit

Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Burnham laboratory, Essex, UK.",NA,Attribution (CC BY),,Broadscale benthic survey undertaken by CEFAS off the east coast of the United Kingdom.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was any evidence of a large-scale cumulative impact on benthic macro-invertebrate communities as a result of the multiple sites of aggregate extraction located off Great Yarmouth in the southern North Sea.  Forty 0.1m2 Hamon grab samples were collected from across the region, both within and beyond the extraction area, and analysed for macrofauna and sediment particle size distribution in order to produce a regional description of the status of the seabed environment.  In addition, the data were analysed in relation to the area of seabed impacted by dredging over the period 1993-1998.  Areas subject to ‘direct’ impacts were determined through reference to annual electronic records of dredging activity and this information was then used to model the likely extent of areas potentially subject to ‘indirect’ ecological and geophysical impact.  Results showed the study area to be characterised by sands in the northern half of the survey area, and sandy gravels in the south.  The low diversity communities found across much of the survey area were typical of mobile sandy sediments.  However, stations located in the southern half and northern extreme of the survey area tended to support higher numbers of species and individuals.  This may be due to marginally enhanced stability arising from the higher proportion of gravel found in samples to the south of the extraction licences and to the presence of Sabellaria spinulosa reef in the north.  Analysis of data in relation to areas of predicted dredging impact revealed proportionally less gravel and more sand within the ‘direct’ impact zone, compared to the ‘indirect’ impact zone.  Whilst multivariate analyses of macrofaunal data were unable to discriminate between dredging impact zones, a comparison of univariate measures revealed significantly lower numbers of species and individuals in areas which have been subject to ‘direct’ dredging impacts in comparison with ‘reference’ areas.  This provides good evidence of the near-field consequences of dredging.  Values of these measures in the ‘indirect’ zone were intermediate, although not significantly different from the ’reference’ zone.  We conclude that, although the dominant influence on assemblages in the region is that of sediment instability induced by tidal currents, we cannot dismiss the possibility of a subsidiary influence of dredging activity in the near vicinity of the licensed block and further investigation is warranted.",Keith Cooper,T,T,"Biology , Benthos , Ecology - biodiversity","Aggregate , Benthos , Hamon grab , Macrobenthos , Macrofauna , Zoöbenthos"

<b>Rationale of the LTER Project:</b>

<i>""The future has already arrived; it just isn't evenly distributed""</i> (W. Gibson)

This is exactly our problem with the response of ecosystems to long-term trends in climate and environment. Owing to ecosystem complexity and variability in space and time, the phenomena we deal with are either long term in their dynamics, or episodic, rare, complex or subtle in their occurrence and/or manifestation. Only long-term studies, combined with experimental approaches, can reveal ecosystem dynamics, patterns and control processes. Hence, long-term research is essential to make and justify management and policy decisions regarding the protection of ecosystems and the maintenance of ecosystem services, particularly in times of potentially rapid climate change.

<b>Objectives of the LTER Project:</b>

<ul><li>To continue/establish time series of relevant and representative ecological parameters at different levels of ecosystem organisation.<li>To create well documented databases and archives of samples and specimens that are accessible to the scientific community.<li>To analyze these time series for trends and cycles by means of modern analytical  and modelling approaches.<li>To relate the observed patterns to external forcing factors on regional and global scales by means of empirical and mechanistic models.<li>To establish a cause-and-effect understanding of these relationships by analytical and experimental approaches.<li>To model future ecological developments based on the observed relationships between forcing factors and ecological parameters.<li>To provide knowledge to the broader scientific community, general public, resource managers, and policy makers to address complex environmental challenges.</ul>

At each location, five sediment samples for macrofauna analysis were collected using a 0.1 m² day grab from the central point of a 500 m grid of 9 stations, the latter being sampled for contaminant analyses only. The five replicates were collected from within a 100 m range ring, using SEXTANT software and DGPS position-fixing.

The depth of sediment in the closed jaws of the grab was determined, as an indication of sample volume. Very small samples (i.e. less than about 5 cm depth) were discarded. A visual description of the sediment type was recorded, together with the location and times at which the sample was collected, and the prevailing sea state, wind strength, and water depth.

The REBENT project aims to collect and format data relating to seabed habitats and associated benthic biocenosis living along the coasts, in order to give scientists, marine environment management bodies and the general public, relevant and coherent data which will improve our knowledge the current resources and detect spatiotemporal evolutions. These observations, which concern data relating to spatial extension and to fauna and flora distribution, are common to various needs : accidental pollutions, protected marine reserves, Water Directive, integrated management.
The entire French seawaters are likely to be concerned by the project. But regarding the new acquisitions tidal zones and coastal waters have been singled out as priority areas, in the framework of the Water Directive, thus concentrating as much attention as possible on the protected marine reserves.
The following parameters are taken into consideration when selecting seabed habitats / biocenosis : representativeness, importance of ecology, sensitivity and vulnerability.

The foreshore suppletion (400.000m³) was by means of an experimental set-up in the shallow coastal zone (-1 to -2m TAW) of Mariakerke. Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone. In both studies, the subtidal area is the zone between the low water line and the 6m depth line and the intertdial area is the zone between low and high tide water line.","This dataset contain the macrobenthic data collected in the subtidal area. Macrobenthos are the biota that lives in the sediment and are retained on a sieve of 1mm. The sampling design for the monitoring is following the BACI-design (Before After Control Impact), with a control area with similar habitat characteristics outside the influence of the suppletion activity. There is sampled before the suppletion and in the following two years after suppletion. In this BACI-monitoring, the seasonal aspect is taken into account, by taking samples in spring (March) and autumn (September). In the subtidal area, three depth strata were determined to investigated the influence of the suppletion outside the suppletion area. Stratum a (between low water line and -2m TAW) is the area were the foreshore suppletion is executed. Stratum b and c are taken respectively the depth zones -3m to -4m and -5m to -6m TAW. The amount of sampling locations was determined by the client and determines 15 points for each sampling moment. That amount of samples was via a systematic random stratified strategy distributed over each stratum (5 in each strata). The samples were taken with a Van Veen grab (0.1m²). The samples were sieved alive on a 1mm sieve and then fixed with an 8% formaldehyde-seawater solution. The sieved material is stained with eosin. All biota were determined and counted to species level following a standardized taxonomic discrimination protocol. This to determine the determination level and if certain life stages (larvae, juveniles) need to be discriminated. The biomass is determined as wet weight.

Focus area of the dataset spans from north of Wimereux (northern France) to the Scheldt estuary (southern Netherlands).,"With TISBE, VLIZ tries to develop a comprehensive list of species recorded from the Belgian coast, the Southern Bight of the North Sea and the surrounding countries. The focal area for this database spans from northern France (rocky shores north of Wimereux, where the fauna changes dramatically) to southern Holland, including the Delta area and whole of the tidal part of the Scheldt estuary. Distributions from further away are recorded only if the are listed in publications dealing mainly with distribution records from the focus area. The precision with which the distribution records, both on the geographical and on the temporal scale, are recorded, is variable: the closer a record is to the focal area, the more details we try and record. 

The sources of information are mainly published literature. All distribution records contain a description of the source. Leaving such an 'audit trail' makes it possible to check the validity of every single distribution record by going back to the sources of our information. 

TISBE is build on top of VLIZ's species register, Aphia, and this web application always contains links to taxonomic details, and other taxon-specific information, as they are known in Aphia. From within TISBE, only those species are visible that are known to occur in the area.",Leen Vandepitte,F,NA,"Biology , Benthos , Macroalgae , Phytoplankton , Zooplankton , Reptiles , Fish , Birds , Mammals","Bibliografische informatie , Biogeografie , Biologie , Ecologie , Habitat , Morfologie (organismen) , Taxonomie"

146,Epi- and hyperbenthic communities of Belgian sandy beaches,,NA,Attribution (CC BY),NA,"This is the first study on the epi- and hyperbenthic fauna of the surf zone of sandy beaches of the Belgian coast. Therefore, as a first objective of this thesis, a lot of attention has been paid to the inventarisation (species composition), and to the investigation of the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of both communities. A temporal and a spatial campaign were performed during which the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled.","During the temporal campaign monthly samples were taken at 4 selected stations and the spatial campaign involved sampling of 12 stations along the Belgian coast. All in all, the surf zone of the Belgian coast is a habitat for a considerable number of species. The surf zone harbours a rich hyperbenthic fauna and also the epibenthic assemblage is diverse. Total hyper- and epibenthic densities were comparable or even higher than those of the adjacent, subtidal regions. It seems that the Belgian surf zone can be seen as an extension of the rich shallow sand bank system in front of the coast. Differences in total hyperbenthic densities with other European sandy beaches might be linked to the degree of exposure. An attempt was made to elucidate the major environmental variables structuring the communities. Therefore several environmental variables were measured at the moments of sampling. Different uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used for the analyses of the data. Although clear temperature-related seasonal distribution patterns were observed, the hyper- and epibenthic communities of the surf zone can also be influenced severely by hydrodynamic factors and this both by short-term events (e.g. storm) and long-term effects (influence on morpho- dynamics of the beach). Spatial differences were found both in species richness and in density. In general, highest hyper- and epibenthic densities were found on flat, wide beaches, but also intermediate sites and sites with a high turbidity were characterised with high densities and a high number of species. Although clear distribution patterns could be observed, the much lower densities of the epibenthos compared to the hyperbenthos, might require a higher sampling effort with replicate sampling in future research. Furthermore, this study indicates that both intertidal and subtidal characteristics should be considered if the (mobile) surf zone fauna is investigated. Stomach/gut content analyses were performed on five common flatfish fish species from epibenthic samples taken during the temporal campaign in order to unravel part of the surf zone food web. Additional fish were obtained from commercial fishermen. Prey items of all species included hyperbenthic (e.g. mysids), endobenthic (e.g. polychaetes) and epibenthic (e.g. shrimps) species. Little dietary overlap was observed. If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of the studied beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results confirm the opportunistic utilisation by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Such opportunistic utilisation of food resources can be important for teleosts frequenting physically stressed environments such as surf-exposed beaches. The diets of turbot Scophthalmus maximus and brill Scophthalmus rhombus reveal part of the main interactions between the hyper- and epibenthos, whereas those of plaice Pleuronectes platessa, dab Limanda limanda and sole Solea solea reveal important links between the epibenthos and the macro-endobenthos within the local surf zone food web. Three 24-hours sampling cycles were performed to study short term migration patterns. Again the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled alternatingly each hour. Stomach content analyses were performed on juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa of the first 24h-cycle (spring tide). Possible interactions between the epi- and hyperbenthic organisms are discussed. Despite the turbulent conditions of the studied sites, clear tidal (e.g. I-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa, the brown shrimp Crangon crangon) and diurnal (e.g. juvenile sole Solea solea) periodicities were observed in many macrocrustacean and demersal fish species. An opportunistic utilisation of available food resources is again suggested as I-group plaice clearly migrate high up the beach during flood to disperse in order to profit from the rich macrobenthic area (mainly the polychaete Scolelepis squamata and ends of Arenicola species), while the 0-group feeds mainly on the most abundant hyper- and macrobenthic organisms from somewhat deeper water (mainly palps of the polychaete Magelona papillicornis and cyprid larvae). Finally, it can be concluded that the Belgian surf zone functions as a nursery and/or transient are for hyper- as well as epibenthic stages of several species.",Bregje Beyst,F,NA,"Biology , Benthos , Coastal studies (e.g. shores, estuaries)","Bentische gemeenschappen , Epibenthos , Hyperbenthos , Stranden , Zandige stranden"

A standard 2 m Lowesoft beam trawl with a 3 mm mesh codend liner was deployed for 5-10 min across each station at a speed of about 0.5 m/s. The ""start"" (locking of winch following seabed contact) and ""end"" (commencement of hauling) positions were recorded. Tow length averaged about 400 m, but varied substantially (s.d. = 290) depending on tidal current velocity and wind strength at the time of sampling. On retrieval of the trawl, an estimate of sample volume was made, along with a summary of the contents, noting especially the presence of stones, rock, etc. The sample was then sorted on deck over a 5 mm mesh sieve. Most specimens were identified and enumerated at sea. Any problematic specimens were preserved in formalin for identification on land.

It has been conducted in the third or fourth quarter except in 1991 where it took place in May. In 1988 two survey were conducted, one in May the other in October.

The Celtic Sea was surveyed from 1990 to 1994 but the sampling was restricted to a small geographical area. The duration is between 40 to 45 days depending on year and availability of ship. Since 1997, the survey covered all the Celtic Sea and Bay of Biscay during the 4th quarter.

The French demersal survey began in 1987. The survey area was first limited to the Bay of Biscay (ICES Divisions VIIh, VIIIa,b,c and d) and in 1990, the survey area was extended towards the north to cover the grounds of Celtic sea deeper than 100 meters (ICES Divisions VIIe,f,g,h and j). 

Prior to 1997, the sampling designs were as follows: In the Bay of Biscay (ICES Divisions VIIh, VIIIa,b,c and d) a stratified sampling scheme was originally used. 

The area was divided according to latitude into 3 blocks and the hauls were distributed in seven depth zones (15-30, 31-80, 81-120, 121-160, 161-200, 201-400, 401-600 m). 100 hauls were made at fixed locations and 35 at changeable stations from year to year. Since 1989, all the hauls (mean number by survey 135) are made at the same locations.

In the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VIIe,f,g,h and j) the sampling design was systematic, stations were located at the intersection points of a grid of lines 25 nautical miles apart both in latitude and in longitude. The mean number of sets was 56.

From 1997 onwards the whole area has been separated in 5 geographical strata or sectors: southern Bay of Biscay (GS) and northern Bay of Biscay (GN), southern Celtic Sea (CS), central Celtic sea (CC) and northern Celtic sea (CN). In each sector a depth-stratified sampling strategy has been adopted with 7 depth ranges: 0-30, 31-80, 81-120, 121-160, 161-200, 201-400 and 401-600 m. 

The sampling design is a stratified random allocation. The number of hauls per stratum is optimised by a Neyman allocation taking into account the most important commercial species in the area (hake, monkfish and megrim). Minimum of two stations per stratum is sampled and 140 fishing stations are planned every year. This number of hauls is adjusted according to the ship time available at sea. 

Catch weight and catch numbers were recorded for all species, only selected finfish and shellfish species were measured until 1990. Since 1991, all finfish and a selection of shellfish (mainly nephrops and squids) are measured. 

Since 1997, the French survey has been carried out on the R/V Thalassa, a stern trawler of 73.7 m length by 14.9 m wide, gross tonnage of 3022 t. The fishing gear used is a GOV 36/47 without exocet Kite which is replaced by 6 additional floats. In average, the gear has a horizontal opening of 20 m and a vertical opening of 4 m.

A broad spectrum of data is collected during the survey, but the overriding objective is to provide information on commercially exploited fish stocks. In particular the survey provides an index of the proportion of juveniles in the stock, which in turn gives an indication of its spawning success. This is an important source of information not available from commercial landings due to the necessary minimum fish length restrictions on commercial catches. 

In addition, the survey provides data on species and environmental parameters in areas of both high and low commercial activity. This gives a better context to data for the entire survey area as opposed to focusing entirely on traditional fishing hot-spots that can remain stable while significant changes in surrounding background abundance and distribution go un-noticed.

The primary goal of the groundfish survey is to develop estimates of juvenile abundance for important species. Measurements of the abundance of juvenile fish are a critical measure of the health of a stock, serving as an annual indication of recruitment (the number of newly spawned fish which enter the population each year) success or failure. Most importantly, they allow forecasting of future commercial abundance. 

Survey provides data on the distribution and biology of commercial and non-commercial species of ecological interest, as well as hydrographic and environmental observations. When these data are combined with annual recruitment indices they can help identify the possible causes driving year-class success or failure, and allow us to see long-term changes in populations that may have been caused by fishing, pollution, or climate change. This spatial dataset comprises the haul station location from the trawl survey. The Irish Groundfish Survey feeds into the International Bottom Trawl Survey [ie. IBTS] for international reporting. 

The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey started in 1990 and for the first two years consisted of circa 25 stations concentrated around the Irish coast in ICES Areas Via South and VIIb. Adverse weather in 1992 limited station coverage to only 4 stations which effectively broke the time series.

The survey was re-established in 1993 and has consisted of circa 70 stations, for Parts A and B combined, since then. Spatial coverage was extended west out to the 200m contour, but remains as Via South and VIIb.

Due to the restrictions of the current and previous research vessel commercial trawlers have been contracted to carry out the survey work. Wherever possible continuity of vessel and gear has been maintained and standard IBTS methodology applied. However, due to reduced staffing on commercial vessels it has rarely been possible to completely sort the catch.

Until 2000 all cod were sorted from the catch and then a sub-sample of two baskets was taken and completely sorted. From 2001 onwards, in response to an overall review of survey sampling undertaken during the IPROSTS Project (Anon 2001), the catch is completely sorted for all target species and a qualitative assessment made of the residual catch as a minimum.

The Irish surveys use an ICES rectangle based sampling strategy. The sampling design attempts to allocate at least two stations per rectangle (where the sea area is appropriate). Stations are selected randomly within each rectangle from known clear tow positions.

On the WCGS and ISCGS circa 70 fishing stations are planned on each survey every year. The number of hauls is adjusted according to the ship time available at sea.

The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey is carried out in two parts: Part A covers ICES Division Via (south) and VIIb (north); Part B covers ICES Division VIIb and VIIj. The survey is conducted from 15 to 300 m depths during the fourth quarter (October - November). The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey is carried out on chartered commercial fishing vessels. Whilst the same vessel (MFV Marliona, 224 gross tonnage and 30 m LOA) has normally been used each year for Part A and Sionann for Part B, in 2001 Part B was conducted from the MFV Regina Ponti (34.5 m LOA). Both vessels use a Rockhopper net with 12 inch discs and 11 inch Thyboron doors. The nets are fitted with a 20 mm codend liner. Gear performance throughout the survey is monitored using Furuno Ch24 (Headline Monitor).

The Irish Sea Celtic Ground Survey commenced in 1997 and evolved from an earlier Irish Sea Juvenile Fish Survey. As a consequence early survey stations concentrated largely, though not exclusively, around a number of shallow spawning areas along the Irish east coast in VIIa. These positions were expanded in combination with clear tows provided by the industry and CEFAS as well as some exploratory tows.

Spatial coverage therefore extended into the western Irish Sea from 2001 into the area around the Isle of Man, Liverpool and Cardigan Bays and the Welsh coast. The survey is carried out on the Irish research vessel the R.V. Celtic Voyager.

The sampling procedure on board conforms to the IBTS standard protocols and as such all cod are sampled and aged, the entire catch is sorted and then sub-sampled as and where appropriate.

The Irish survey in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea covers ICES Division VIIa and VIIg. The survey is conducted from 10 to 150 m depths during the fourth quarter (November-December) by the RV Celtic Voyager. This vessel is 32 m in length with gross tonnage of 340 t. The fishing gear used is a GOV 28.9/37.1 Trawl with Morgere Kite (0.85 by 0.85m). Mean vertical opening is 6 m and door spread 48 m. Morgere Polyvalent doors (Type AA4.5) are used and gear performance is monitored throughout the survey using the SCANMAR (RX400) net monitoring system (Headline height, Door spread).

Trials on the new 65m research vessel, the R.V. Celtic Explorer, are due to commence in late 2002. Therefore, from 2003 onwards all Irish Surveys will be conducted on this new vessel, starting around mid October through to late November.",Neil Holdsworth,F,NA,Fish,

As it was gradually realised that the survey also yielded valuable information for other fish species, such as cod and haddock, the objectives were broadened and the survey was renamed into the International Young Fish Survey (IYFS). Besides the IYFS, which was carried out in the first quarter, a number of national surveys developed in the 1970's and 1980's that were mainly carried out in the third quarter. 

In 1990 ICES decided to combine the international and the national surveys into the IBTS. The IBTS is carried out twice per year (1st and 3rd Quarters) since 1997 and on a quarterly basis in the period 1991-1996.

Prior to 1977 there was no standardisation of gear although all ships used bottom trawls with a small mesh cover. In 1977 ICES recommended that all ships should use a GOV trawl as specified by the Institut des Peches Maritimes, Boulogne. A detailed description of the net is to be found in the manual (Anon. 2004). The GOV trawl has been gradually phased in, e.g. in 1979 only 3 vessels were equipped with the GOV trawl, but by 1983 all 8 nations were using this gear. It should be noted that although the gear is now standard, variations in the rigging exist between the various countries. 

The fishing method is also standardized and described in the manual (Anon. 2004). Fishing speed is 4 knots measured as trawl speed over the ground. In 1977 ICES also recommended that the duration of a tow should be reduced from an hour to half an hour with the catch data to be expressed in numbers per hour. All nations accepted this recommendation although it was a number of years before 30 minutes became the standard.",Neil Holdsworth,F,NA,Fish,

Stratification is by depth and seabed type. Haul duration is 3 nautical miles at 3 knots over the seabed. Stations in the St George's Channel are 1 nautical mile at 3 knots and have only been surveyed since October 2001. Number of stations is 45 in northern Irish Sea and 12 in St George's Channel. Tows are during day time only.

The surveys have been carried out in March and October since 1992. From March 1992 to March 2001, the survey extended from 54° 43' N to 53° 22' N. From October 2001 the survey is extended into the St George's Channel to 52° 18' N. Depth range is from 20 to 120m.

The Quarter 1 Scottish Groundfish survey started in 1981 and was initially intended to cover the fishing grounds on the continental shelf to the west of Scotland; in 1996 the survey area was extended to include the northern Irish Sea.","The Scottish West Coast Surveys use a similar ICES rectangle based sampling strategy to that used in the North Sea. Trawl stations are selected at one tow per rectangle based on a library of clear tows. There is no explicit return to the same trawling position every year, although this is generally the case. 

Since 1999 the potential for using a depth rather than rectangle based stratification has been under investigation. To this end, and where possible, those rectangles which display substantial internal depth variation have been sampled twice at different depths. The recent inclusion of samples collected between 200 and 500m would suggest that depth stratification should be initiated as soon as possible.

The survey covers Division Via and extends into the northern part of the Irish Sea and north west of Ireland. The depth range covered has been 20 to 500m since 2000. The survey is usually carried out in March of each year. The target species are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe and herring and age frequencies are constructed for these species.

The Chinese Mitten Crab, Wakame and Carpet Sea Squirt data was collated in conjunction with the Marine Biological Association. RISC is embedded within the GB-NNSIP alongside species selected as ALERT for which on-line records allow for rapid notification to the Non-Native Species Secretariat. RISC was established in raise awareness of invasive non-native species and to increase distribution data for a selection of species considered to meet a number of criteria which ensured their suitability for recording by the public. Increasing the availability of distribution data is an important component of the Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain.

Methods of data capture: The data is collected by members of the public reporting their sightings through an on-line recording form (powered by Indicia).

Geographical coverage: The geographic extent of the RISC dataset is GB. Ireland records non-native species through Invasive Ireland. The majority of records in this dataset are collated with six figure grid-references.

Temporal coverage: RISC has been promoted both during the initial launch phase and subsequently through conference talks and media attention. Additionally RISC includes mostly high profile species. The Chinese Mitten Crab has been the subject of an intense campaign of recording by the MBA with relevant partners. Therefore, recording activity is likely to have been maintained at a high level.

Therefore it is not yet complete.","Purpose of data capture: The majority of the records have come from volunteers as part of the activities of the Isle of Wight Natural History and Archaeological Society whose objectives include the promotion and advancement of the study of the flora, fauna, geology and archaeology of the county.

Methods of data capture: Historic data before 1970s has come from books and journals. Data from the last 40 years has mostly come from ad hoc field survey by local experts and enthusiasts, though there have been some targetted surveys, including surveys done for the Nature Conservancy Council.

Geographical coverage: Isle of Wight and nearby waters. The records are largely ad-hoc and coverage is incomplete. The records in this dataset were provided with four or six figure grid-references but these grid references refer to the approximate central location of sites and hence may not represent the actual location of the species occurrence.

Temporal coverage: From 1853 to 2011. Records up to 1980s are generally to year only; after this time records are more usually to MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY.

More then 10,000 divers have already registered with Diveboard and the community is still growing. This dataset contains all observations made by Diveboarders worldwide (mainly fishes) and are linked to the Encyclopedia of Life. The Diveboard community has dedicated the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver, so these can be used as widely as possible. If you have a specific survey need or question, get in touch: Diveboarders are everywhere and willing to help!","Purpose - Diveboarders share their data with the desire to help the scientific community in research towards protecting the biodiversity of our oceans, seas, and freshwater bodies. So far, the data are not generated with any overarching purpose, other than completing ones personal digital log of dives.

Additional information - The data is collected with the help of divers all around the world. If you have questions regarding surveying specific dive sites, you can contact us at support@diveboard.com and we will see what we can do. The dataset was standardized, documented and published with the help of Datafable, a team of open data volunteers. The process is documented here: https://github.com/Datafable/diveboard-gbif.

Taxonomic coverage - The dataset covers animals (and very few plants) observed during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. Close to 80% of the observations are fishes (Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii). Diveboarders can log their dives online, including the species they observed, using the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org) as a checklist. Most of the observations are identified to species level, though some caution regarding the identifications is appropriate. In case of doubt, the observer/identifier can be contacted via the references field, which references his/her Diveboard profile.

Study extent - The dataset covers recorded observations made during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. As such there is no specific geographic or temporal study extent, although most dives logged on Diveboard were conducted in well known divespots, such as reefs and wrecks. In a later phase, specific surveys might also be logged on Diveboard.

Sampling description - Observations are not recorded with a specific goal in mind and only reflect what the diver has noticed during the dive. Divers rarely conduct a full inventory of a dive spot, so the observed species only represent part of the occurring species at the time of the dive. There is a sampling bias for known, interesting, noticeable and/or rare species.

Quality control - The Diveboard application restricts divers to only record species found in the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org). As such, all observations are linked to an EOL page in the field taxonID. It is important to note that the data are not validated by specialists.

Method - Event and location conditions (date, time, depth, etc.) are often logged automatically by the dive computer. This data can be imported or manually added by the diver in the Diveboard application, while observed species are added manually. These actions can be done just after surfacing, as the Diveboard application is available online and as a mobile app, which allows divers to record their dive even if no internet connection is available.",Dimitri Brosens,F,NA,"Invertebrates , Macroalgae , Reptiles , Fish","Scuba diving , Vrijwilligers"
